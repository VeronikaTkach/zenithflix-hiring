## Performance Optimization Opportunities

*1. No virtualization, render the entire list at once*

If there are a lot of elements, the page loading will become slow.

You can download data in parts using infinite scroll to limit the initial loading.
Also you can use virtualization - windowing (react-virtualized). In this case a small part of the entire collection of elements is rendered in the DOM at the same time (what falls into the visible area + a small buffer), and the rest of the elements exist “virtually” and appear as you scroll.

*2. No lazy-loading of images in the component*

All image-tag elements load on render immediately, including off-screen. This increases the first render time and affects traffic.
You can use loading="lazy" or/and implement a placeholder skeleton for images (for example: react-loading-skeleton).

*3. Inline styles can seriously affect performance*

If you write styles directly in JSX as an object, then React creates a new object with each render. The browser is forced to recalculate styles, recalculate layout and re-draw a section of the page (so-called layout-threshing). With frequent renders or on long lists, this can seriously affect performance.

You can use static css-classes (for example Tailwind CSS) to avoid creating a class object on every render. If you need exactly dynamic styles you can use useMemo Hook. After the first render, React saves the result of the function and during re-rendering looks at the dependencies, if they have not changed, then returns the saved result without recalculations.

## Accessibility Issues

*1. No semantic markup*

If you use just a div-elements screen readers don’t understand it as the “Trending Now” section. The correct way is to use area-label.

The div-elements block does not allow screen readers to understand what kind of block it is and how it is related to other blocks. Also, the div-elements block does not support keyboard selection.

The Aria-fields allows the screen reader to get information about where the user is on the site, the ability to quickly switch between sections of the site using the keyboard. Aria-label or aria-labelledby allow you to add a descriptive section name, even if there is no heading-tag header inside or it is hidden.

Semantic tags (section, article, nav) plus headings improve SEO and overall structure, provide maximum benefit even without aria-fields, but can be used together.

*2. Cards do not interact with the keyboard.*

The card is a div-element, does not have an onClick event, and therefore is not available for interaction with the keyboard, does not respond to pressing Enter, Space and Tab. It seems to use a button-tag, but if you need to use div-element you can add a role="button", onClick event and tabIndex={} so that the screen reader perceives the card as a clickable element.

*3. Loading/error statuses aren’t announced to screen readers*

If you show the user the text “Loading content…” or an error message as just a div-element, screen readers won’t say anything until the user reaches that element in the document flow. And if there’s a spinner or the word “Error” hanging around at that time, the person might not hear it, even if they’re focusing on the main content.

It must be used: role="status" (for loading), role="alert" (for error), aria-live (a way to declare dynamic changes, such as polite).

## 3. Code Structure

*1. Monolithic component mixing UI and fetch logic*

The Separation of Concerns architectural principle is violated here. Each module should be responsible for one task. Mixing fetch logic and UI leads to a violation of this principle. Flexibility, scalability and predictability of behavior are lost. Problems: complexity of testing and maintenance.

To fix this, you can:
- move the loading logic to a custom hook,
- create a container component that receives data from the hook, passes it to child components, contains checks, spinners, etc.,
- allocate all visualization to a separate component that receives data through props.

*2. No reusable components*

The project probably reuses the card, loading spinner, and pagination, so they should be moved to separate components. A monolithic approach to writing a component can cause difficulties with writing tests and duplicating code on different pages.

Here, the card should be divided into a shell (states, clicks, indents, hooks) and a nested component (getting an image, text, progress bar from props). The following should be moved to separate components: loader, pagination, and a custom hook for state management.

The forward and back buttons will probably be used in other places on the site. In this case, you can create a component that will receive current values ​​via props and contain the logic for the buttons and keyboard handling, styles, and hover animations.

*3. Duplicated “Previous”/“Next” button code*

In this case, instead of two similar button elements, you can write a pagination component that will include both of these buttons, semantic tags, logic, and can be used in other places in the application.

Example:

<Pagination
  currentPage={page}
  totalPages={total}
  onPrev={() => setPage(p => p - 1)}
  onNext={() => setPage(p => p + 1)}
  className="mt-4 justify-center"
/>
